# Hardhat ERC20 Token Project

## Introduction

This project, guided by Patrick Collins' course, focuses on understanding and creating ERC20 tokens. I, Andrei Yazepchyk, embarked on this journey to deepen my knowledge of Ethereum tokens, exploring both manual creation and utilization of OpenZeppelin libraries.

## Project Overview

The project encompasses the development of ERC20 tokens using Hardhat. It involved two primary phases:

1. **Manual Token Creation**: Initially, I created an ERC20 token manually to grasp the underlying mechanisms and standards of ERC20 tokens.
2. **OpenZeppelin Implementation**: Subsequently, I implemented the ERC20 token using the OpenZeppelin library, enhancing my understanding of industry-standard practices and the nature of ERC20 tokens.

### Learning Objectives

- Gain a deep understanding of ERC20 tokens and their functionalities.
- Experience the process of creating ERC20 tokens from scratch and using OpenZeppelin.

### Prerequisites

## Acknowledgements

I extend my gratitude to Patrick Collins for his comprehensive course, which significantly contributed to my understanding of ERC20 tokens and Ethereum blockchain development.
